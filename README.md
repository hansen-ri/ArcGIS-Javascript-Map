# Overview

Set out to get my hands dirty in the ARC GIS Mapping tools. The goal was to build an app that tagged local stores and restaurants that would tell a user where the store was and how much gift card credit they had at said store.

The map displays an outline of the Madison County boundaries along with a polygon of the City of Rexburg boundaries. Inside of Rexburg the map holds points/markers that save different locations of various local businesses.

# Future Work

* Import location data from an online source as opposed to typing in the coordinates of each marker on the map.
* Have an actual user interface that will allow for addition of custom points.
* Generate windows when the points are clicked that show business data and credit towards the store.
* Diversify the markers to include color settings that dictate different business types and color-coded amounts of credit.
* Experiment with different marker types and learn how to disengage a polygon click event when a marker is being selected.
* Integrate interface into a mobile app format for best user experience.
